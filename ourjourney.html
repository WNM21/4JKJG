        <p>  On October 30, 2022, I got that infamous text at 11:58, “Hi Wandile, Its Jaydyn, the one who doesn’t cone to church”. You always act innocent when I talk about idliso, but let me remind you how that first online convo went. You explained that you were here to clear your name because of the bad rep (you don’t go to church). I informed you that they’ve brought the food, and I hope you will be the chef next time, to which you responded, “My gran loves cooking for your uncle. I’ll help here and there, but she takes the lead”. I asked you who your granny is as well as for you to not put any weird things in there for me to which you responded “Now I will (thumbs up emoji)[I don’t know where to get emojis on this thing so please do not judge me]. I then said, “Don’t be surprised when it backfires”. 

It backfired. 
(Sidenote: We need to check out your sanctuary in Glenwood.)  

Why am I so confident that it backfired? Because it’s two and a half years later.
I say it backfired because I don’t think you signed up for this. A simple young man who is usually quiet but an occasional yapper who happens to be very possessive and strict (I’m sure Swa thinks that especially when it comes to dress code[again, I’d add an emoji but idk how]). I don’t think you signed up for any of that when you sent the infamous text. On the other side of the coin, though, you have a young man who is highly attracted to you (I mean, who isn’t? Have you seen yourself? God must look at you and beat his chest while saying “God is good” because He can’t help but be a little cocky looking at the wonderful young woman He created and her growth. 

You are beautiful, Ms. Goosebell. You are a creative one who hates being in a box, even if you were the one to design it, you’d still find a way out.  You are an intelligent lady constantly being tested because people are like that, but you still pass those tests. In the period I have known you, I’ve seen how much of a fantastic woman you are, even if you may not see it at times. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and you have given me the best seat. Homebody Jaydyn is a gem, I tell you. 

I asked for a word, and you decided to give me the word “complex”. A Rubik's Cube personified. A beautiful mess, you see it and understand the complexities of it, a lot of people would like to know how to solve it but few do, but I think the most interesting point is that most people would want to keep it solved and not dare move it because they would fail to fix it. Ms. Goosebell, I have seen that Rubik’s Cube is quite well solved (solved and unsolved), and both versions are beautiful. You are not for everyone. I thank you for allowing me to be a part of your life, especially in this manner, but I’d like to be here for it all, complexities or not. I am here for you, Jaydyn Kate Jazzman Goosebell, and I love you very much. Just wanted to remind you that it has been a journey, an interesting one at that, and it is still going to be a long ass journey and I’m here for all of it. Here for all of you. Please do not think that I am here to fix you because of the example made, I’m not here to fix you. You are not broken. I understand what it means to be here, and I am unapologetically choosing to be here. I am here to love you, support you, grow with you, fight, f___, raise kids. Hold your hand through it all, but uyazazi ukuthi unjani, I’ll just have to grab something else. 

For a girl “who doesn’t cone to church” you truly are a blessing to me Ms. Goosebell.
